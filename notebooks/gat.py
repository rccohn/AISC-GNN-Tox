  This model proceeds as follows:

  * Update node representations in graphs with a variant of GAT
  * For each graph, compute its representation by 1) a weighted sum of the node
    representations in the graph, where the weights are computed by applying a
    gating function to the node representations 2) a max pooling of the node

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_tasks: int
      Number of tasks.
    graph_attention_layers: list of int
      Width of channels per attention head for GAT layers. graph_attention_layers[i]
      gives the width of channel for each attention head for the i-th GAT layer. If
      both ``graph_attention_layers`` and ``agg_modes`` are specified, they should have
      equal length. If not specified, the default value will be [8, 8].
    n_attention_heads: int
      Number of attention heads in each GAT layer.
    agg_modes: list of str
      The way to aggregate multi-head attention results for each GAT layer, which can be
      either 'flatten' for concatenating all-head results or 'mean' for averaging all-head
      results. ``agg_modes[i]`` gives the way to aggregate multi-head attention results for
      the i-th GAT layer. If both ``graph_attention_layers`` and ``agg_modes`` are
      specified, they should have equal length. If not specified, the model will flatten
      multi-head results for intermediate GAT layers and compute mean of multi-head results
      for the last GAT layer.
    activation: activation function or None
      The activation function to apply to the aggregated multi-head results for each GAT
      layer. If not specified, the default value will be ELU.
    residual: bool
      Whether to add a residual connection within each GAT layer. Default to True.
    dropout: float
      The dropout probability within each GAT layer. Default to 0.
    alpha: float
      A hyperparameter in LeakyReLU, which is the slope for negative values. Default to 0.2.
    predictor_hidden_feats: int
      The size for hidden representations in the output MLP predictor. Default to 128.
    predictor_dropout: float
      The dropout probability in the output MLP predictor. Default to 0.
    mode: str
      The model type, 'classification' or 'regression'. Default to 'regression'.
    number_atom_features: int
      The length of the initial atom feature vectors. Default to 30.
    n_classes: int
      The number of classes to predict per task
      (only used when ``mode`` is 'classification'). Default to 2.
    nfeat_name: str
      For an input graph ``g``, the model assumes that it stores node features in
      ``g.ndata[nfeat_name]`` and will retrieve input node features from that.
      Default to 'x'.
